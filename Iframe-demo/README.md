#Iframe Demo - Target for a Link

#Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an <iframe> in combination with anchor (<a>) tags to load external content directly within the iframe by targeting it through the target attribute of the anchor tag.

The provided demo uses a list of anime Wikipedia pages as links, each of which opens in the same iframe when clicked. This showcases how to embed dynamic content in your web pages without needing to refresh the page.

#Features
A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
An iframe element that dynamically loads external content when links are clicked.
Beautiful styling with a modern gradient background, shadowed containers, and smooth hover effects on links.
The ability to navigate external content inside the iframe using the target attribute in the anchor tags.

#How It Works
An iframe (<iframe>) is embedded on the page with the name="contentFrame".
Each <a> tag includes the target="contentFrame" attribute, meaning that when a link is clicked, the content of that link is loaded inside the iframe.
The links point to Wikipedia pages for popular anime, such as Naruto, One Piece, and Attack on Titan.
When clicked, these links load the respective page in the iframe, keeping the main page unchanged.
