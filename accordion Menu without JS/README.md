# Accordion Components

This repository contains two types of accordion components:  
1. **Details Accordion**  
2. **Checkbox Accordion**

These components allow for collapsible sections that can expand or collapse based on user interaction.

## Features
- **Details Accordion**: Uses the `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements to create an accordion effect.
- **Checkbox Accordion**: Utilizes checkboxes and labels to manage visibility of content sections.

## Customization
Both components are styled to be lightweight and easy to modify. Feel free to update the styles or add new features as needed.

## Future Updates
- Enhance the visual style of both accordion types.
- Add animations for smoother transitions.
- Make the accordion components more accessible (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA support).
