# Image Hover Effects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to create dynamic image hover effects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The effects include **zoom**, **grayscale**, and **blur**. Each effect is applied randomly, except for the first image, which always uses the zoom effect.

## Features
- **First Image**: Zoom effect on hover.
- **Second Image**: Always uses the grayscale effect on hover.
- **Third Image**: Randomly assigned effect (either grayscale or blur).
- **Smooth Transition**: All hover effects have smooth transitions for better visual experience.
- **Dynamic**: JavaScript is used to apply effects randomly to images, giving a unique touch to each.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or copy the code files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the hover effects in action.
3. Customize the images or effects as needed.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
