# HTML & CSS Text Effect Animations

This project demonstrates three unique text effect animations created using only HTML and CSS. The animations include:

1. **Shining Effect Animation** – A shimmering, glowing text effect.
2. **Typewriter Effect** – Text appears as if being typed out in real-time.
3. **3D Rotation Effect** – Text rotates in 3D space, creating a visually dynamic experience.
